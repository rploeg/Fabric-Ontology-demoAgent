# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving the Fabric Ontology Demo Agent! This repo is lightweight, but a few simple practices keep it tidy and secure.

## How to contribute
- **Issues**: File clear, reproducible issues describing the need, context, and expected outcome.
- **Branches**: Use feature branches (e.g., `feature/<short-purpose>`).
- **Commits**: Keep commits focused; write clear messages (imperative mood, e.g., "Add binding instructions").
- **Pull Requests**:
  - Describe the change, rationale, and testing performed.
  - Keep PRs small and scoped when possible.
  - Link related issues.
- **Testing/Validation**: Run any relevant checks you add (linters, validators, or generators) before opening a PR.

## Code & content style
- Keep documentation concise and actionable.
- Prefer configuration-driven changes to the agent spec over ad-hoc scripts.
- Align terminology with Microsoft Fabric Ontology docs (entity types, bindings, timeseries, graph, etc.).

## Security
- Do not commit secrets or tokens.
- See `SECURITY.md` for how to report vulnerabilities.
