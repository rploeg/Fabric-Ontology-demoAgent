# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security issue, please do **not** create a public issue. Instead:

1. Email the maintainer (ansley.yeo@gmail.com) with a clear description, impact, and reproduction steps.
2. Include any relevant logs or proof-of-concept details privately.
3. We will acknowledge receipt and work with you on resolution and disclosure timing.

## Best Practices for Contributors
- Do not commit secrets, tokens, or credentials.
- Rotate credentials used for testing and keep them out of source control.
- Prefer configuration-driven demos; avoid embedding sensitive environment details in example files.
