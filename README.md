# Fabric Ontology Demo Agent

An expert agent configuration for creating Microsoft Fabric Ontology demo scenarios with realistic sample data, bindings, and guidance. The core configuration lives in `.agentic/fabric-ontology-demo.yaml`, describing entities, relationships, bindings, validation checks, and deliverables.

## What's inside
- **.agentic/fabric-ontology-demo.yaml** — the agent spec covering capabilities, defaults, constraints, sample entities/relationships, known issues, and steps to generate demo assets (TTL, Mermaid, CSVs, bindings, and docs).
- **Docs** — project guidelines for contribution, conduct, and security reporting.

## Getting started
1) Clone the repo:
   - `git clone git@github.com:falloutxAY/Fabric-Ontology-demoAgent.git`
   - or `git clone https://github.com/falloutxAY/Fabric-Ontology-demoAgent.git`
2) Inspect the agent spec: open `.agentic/fabric-ontology-demo.yaml`.
3) Use the spec to generate your demo assets (ontology TTL/Mermaid, CSVs, bindings, and README) following the described agent steps and validation checks.
